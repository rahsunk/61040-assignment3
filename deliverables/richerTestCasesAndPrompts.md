## Richer Test Cases

1.  For Test Case 2: Tasks Only (LLM) and Test Case 3: Mixed (Events + Tasks), I added assertions to check if all of the tasks were scheduled to start during focused hours (9:00 AM - 9:00 PM).

2.  For Test Case 2: Tasks Only (LLM), I changed all task deadlines and expected completion times to be the same and added assertions to see if the scheduled tasks were ordered in decreasing priority level.

3.  For Test Case 3: Mixed (Events + Tasks), I changed all task deadlines and priority levels to be the same and added assertions to see if scheduled tasks (at least the first portion of tasks) were ordered by decreasing completion time.

## Prompt Variants

1. Initially, for Test Case 2, the LLM tended to schedule tasks in the early hours of the day, when students should be sleeping. The first thing I did was to try to update the prompt by giving a list of student preferences by giving preferred times for physical activity, classes/study sessions, and social events. All of these preferences were to be scheduled during active hours of the day. This helped by allowing the LLM to output tasks later in the day, but it started to cause overlaps, which automatically causes the output to fail. I realized that this was caused by conflicting information in the preferences, so I gave more freedom for some of the preferences, such as saying that physical activity is ideal early in the morning or late at night. This helped to resolve most of the issues with the task-only case. When I tried to do this with Test Case 3, I was getting inconsistent results running the test multiple times. Most times, it would fail the assertion despite the given preferences to not schedule activities too early in the morning. I realized that this was caused by the LLM not always understanding the time system, so just like in Prep 2, I explained the time system in the prompt. This improved the correctness rate of the tests, but ocassionally, the model returns schedules with tasks scheduled too early.

2. After adding the descending priority assertions, Test Case 2 was frequently failing, despite the fact that I made the deadline and expected completion time of the tasks to be the same. I first modified the prompt that scheduling tasks with higher priority before lower priority tasks is a hard constraint but that seemed to not have any effect on the code. To resolve this, I modified the generateSchedule action to place more emphasis on priority, but this ended up causing many more overlaps than before. I found out that the code would consider a task starting at the same time as another task ending to be an overlap, and that this instance was what was causing many of my overlapping-related errors to propagate. After resolving this issue, I was getting less overlapping errors than before, but they would still ocassionally occur.

3. Learning from the process of making my implementation schedule tasks with higher priority first, I employed a similar strategy to schedule tasks with greater completion time in Test Case 3. After making changes to the concept implementation so that I can retrieve and track the completion time of the tasks from the blocks in the returned schedule, I modified the prompt to explicitly order tasks with higher completion time first as a hard constraint. After that, I did not seem to get any errors relating to the assertions I added for this test case. However, I would still occasionally get overlapping errors here, like I did with Test Case 2.
