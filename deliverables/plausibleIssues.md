## Plausible Issues and Validators

As mentioned in [my documentation on improving the test cases and prompts](./richerTestCasesAndPrompts.md), the LLM would frequently attempt to schedule a task in an occupied slot. The implementation would detect whenever this happened and throw an error. I asked Cursor AI for some guidance here, and it created a "retry" mechanism such that the Gemini API will be called up to 3 times when generateSchedule is called and an error is encountered. This helped to significantly reduce the number of overlapping errors I received. Another potential issue with the LLM output is that the startTime (defined as integers 0-47 correspond to 30-minute blocks in 12 AM to 11:30 PM) of tasks would not represent an actual time. Hence I had the code assert that startTime was an integer that was in the range 0-47. Additionally, there is the chance that the LLM could hallucinate tasks that were never inputted by the user, so I had the implementation assert that each task from the schedule originates from user input.
